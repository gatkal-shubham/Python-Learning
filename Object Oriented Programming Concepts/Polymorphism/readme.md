Polymorphism : 
        Poly: Many
        Morph: Forms
i.e. One thing can take multiple forms
Example : As human we have mutliple forms,as the situation change we change our forms ( in office we behave differntly ,in friends we behave differntly ,at home we behave differently) in the same way objects have multiple forms

There are 4 ways of implementing Polymorphism:
    1. Duck Typing
    2. Operator Overloading
    3. Method Overloading (Python does not directly support method overloading but we can implement it inderectly)
    4. Method Overriding 

Duck Typing in Python:
    1. If there is a bird which is waking like a bird ,quaking like a bird and swimming like a duck then that bird is duck which simply means it doesn't matter it is duck or not ,what matters is if behavior of that bird is mathching with duck that means its a duck
    ( if it looks like duck swims like a duck, then it probably is a duck).
    Dynamic typing : means the type you can mention later
